# Pandas-Challenge

This folder pertains to the analysis of a dataset, that contained purchase data for players, of a fantasy video game called Heroes of Pymoli. It contains the following:
1.	Two versions of the Jupyter Notebook files:
a.	 Jupyter Notebook Version 1 - - this contains the code that generates the results of the analysis on the screen.
b.	Jupyter Notebook Version 2 - - this contains not only the code that generates the results of the analysis on the screen, but also has additional code that can write the output to a CSV file. Please note that this additional code is currently commented out, but can easily be added back in by removing the # character in front of the commented out code. 
2.	A word document (called Analysis Report) which contains a report with key insights and supporting charts.
3.	A folder called Resources that contains the source dataset that was used for the analysis.
4.	A folder called Output that contains the CSV files that will be created by Jupyter Notebook Version 2 (if the user chooses to write the output to CSV files).


The dataset had the following details for 780 distinct purchases made by 576 players:
•	User Name
•	User Gender
•	User Age
•	User Purchases 
•	Purchased Item Name
•	Purchased Item Price


The dataset was analyzed using pandas which is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. A detailed analysis of the data identified the following key insights that we believe will be helpful for the creators of Heroes of Pymoli to optimize its marketing efforts to its target audiences:

1.	Gender-based Metrics:
a.	Males accounted for the highest number of players who made purchases - - 484 out of 576 total players (84% of the total), followed by:

ii.	“Other/Undisclosed” Category, who accounted for 11 players (2% of the total).

2.	Age-based Metrics:
a.	Players in the Age Group 20-24 accounted for the highest number of players who made purchases - - 258 out of 576 total players (45% of the total), followed by:

ii.	Age Group 25-29: 	77 players (13% of the total).
b.	Players in the Age Group of 40+ 	accounted for the lowest number of players who made purchases - - 12 players (2% of the total).
